@title{Package Notes (@splitflap-version[])}

Splitflap can be considered stable. No backward-incompatible changes are planned.

@section{Known Issues}

See Splitflap’s @hyperlink["https://github.com/otherjoel/splitflap/issues"]{issues tracker on Github}
for any known problems with the library, or to report problems.

@subsection{Non-ASCII email addresses and domains}

The @Atom1.0[] and @RSS2.0[] specs do not contemplate or allow for the use of non-ASCII characters
in email addresses or domain names, which is a defect considering that non-English alphabets are in
widespread use for both of these things.

At this early stage I have chosen to enforce the standards as written, for consistency’s sake. I do
plan to add a parameter which would cause @racket[dns-domain?] and @racket[email-address?] to
validate strings according to some alternative scheme that allows for non-ASCII characters. In order
to do this correctly, though, I need to educate myself about any standards that exist in this area.
