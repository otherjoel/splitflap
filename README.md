## Installation

Splitflap requires Racket 8.1 or higher. To install Splitflap from the command line:

    > raco pkg install splitflap

Or using DrRacket: click the **File** menu ‚Üí **Install Package ‚Ä¶** and enter `splitflap`.

If deploying Splitflap in a production environment, you probably want to use `splitflap-lib` instead
of `splitflap`. This will avoid fetching/building the docs, and will greatly reduce the number of
dependencies installed.
